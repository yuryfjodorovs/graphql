# GraphQL Countries Part 4

This part is a continuation of [graphql-countries-part2](https://github.com/luisw19/graphql-samples/tree/master/graphql-countries-part3).
In this part we'll refactor the code to support more complicated queries whereby individual **fields** are fetched from other APIs.

In this example, we'll add a new field called **currencyExchange** that will be based on the result of fetching the exchange value of a cuntries currency against a pre-defined currency using the API [Currency Converter](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/).

Following the steps on how to do this:
